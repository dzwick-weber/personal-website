The School of Computing at Weber State University is offering twelve scholarships for student internships during the summer of 2025. 
These internships are joint projects with industry partners, and should involve work in data science, machine learning, data analytics, or data engineering. 
They are full-time, 12 weeks, and 40 hours per week. These scholarships include:

* A $7,500 stipend for the intern.
* A $1,500 stipend for a faculty project mentor.

Each project must have an industry sponsor who will work with the student throughout the 12 week internship. 
This industry partner will work with the student on the project’s specifics and provide the data and tools for the project, possibly assisted by computing resources from Weber State.

At the conclusion of the internship, the students will prepare and present a summary of their project at an event hosted by Weber State. These presentations will be recorded and may be made available to faculty and future students. 

The internships will take place between May 5th and August 22nd, 2025. This is a 16 week period, and the 12 weeks of the internship will depend on the specifics of the intern's and the industry partner's schedules.
It is designed so interns can have some time off over the summer as well.

The intern’s responsibilities include:

* Work full time with the industry partner for 12 weeks. This may include attending trainings or meetings, assisting members of the company, and internal company presentations. 
* Meet with the faculty mentor (probably online) to track progress and discuss the project’s status.
* Create a final presentation of work to present at a Weber State event at the conclusion of the internship.

To apply for the internship please provide:

* A completed intern application ([pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/10wp2KVrtt50Bg2uFXssntsfktPMXfjcX/view?usp=sharing), [doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1V2mWTrti3P85p_Q7D-RjpygXC_WPEsnm/edit?usp=drive_link&ouid=111673645041241607360&rtpof=true&sd=true))

Please email applications to Prof. Dylan Zwick (dylanzwick@weber.edu). Please email him with any questions you may have as well.

If the intern has a faculty mentor and / or industry partner in mind, please specify that in the internship application. Otherwise, Prof. Dylan Zwick will work with you to find a faculty mentor and industry partner.

We are working to fill these internships quickly, and earlier applicants get priority. So, if you're interested, please apply ASAP.
